USER INSTRUCTIONS:
the purpose of this task is to enable the system to record the football teams within the league table throughout a season. 
1. to do this, the league class has already been made, this league class reads the data files and cunstorcts teams and matches and also prints out the final league table. 
2. the first thing we have to do is to create a match table which keeps track of the match. this will contains of two strings of the two football team names and 2 integer fields which holds the scores of the team
3. the next step is to make a return method, as when you go to inspect, it will diplay the names of the teams, and also the goals. 
4. the next step was to create a team class which holds the details of the team, the goals, win and loses etc. 
5. the first thing we had to do is to construct the team class, which will allow the user to enter the Team name and its short name. I then provided a local variable to each of the fields.
6. i then made a return method for each of the fields. 
for the play method, i started of by "played ++" which means that the played will increase by one each game played.
the first thing is we assingng tha local varable that the goals scored against and for will start of as 0. the next step was to create an if statement which says that if the shortname is home teams name, then the goals for is the home goals then the goalsagainst is the away teams goal, else the goals for is the away team then the goals against is the home teams.
